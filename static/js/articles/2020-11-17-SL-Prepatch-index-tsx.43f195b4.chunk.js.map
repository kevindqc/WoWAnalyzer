The Shadowlands\r\n    pre-expansion patch is now live; the expansion launch and its first tier <em>Castle Nathria</em> are\r\n    soon to follow. We are proud to go into the Shadowlands with tons of new features and\r\n    improvements since we were last here at the start of BFA. Boss phase filtering, guild reports\r\n    search, a full site-wide UI revamp, and consistent spec updates definitely kept us busy for the\r\n    last two years.\r\n\r\n    <br/><br/>That said... now, more than ever, we need <em>you</em>. In Shadowlands, classes are\r\n    getting more changes and features at once than ever before. We've been hard at work for the past months\r\n    researching on the beta, scouring through reports, and collaborating with class experts to bring\r\n    you the best metrics and suggestions possible to help improve your play. However, time is short\r\n    and a few specs are still in need of some loving maintenance. Please check out\r\n    the <Link to=\"/specs\">specs</Link> tab or visit\r\n    our <a href=\"https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues\">GitHub</a> to see if you might\r\n    be able to help. Then, join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/AxphPxU\">Discord</a> for answers to\r\n    common questions or to ask for assistance or feedback. We provide monthly gametime to maintainers!\r\n\r\n    <br/><br/>During the prepatch, analysis might be a bit skewed or missing some of the suggestions\r\n    and statistics you are used to seeing. To aid us in the massive expansion overhaul, we've been\r\n    trimming some of the BFA features like azerite even though they aren't disabled for prepatch.\r\n    We hope you bear with us while we're under construction!\r\n\r\n    <br/><br/>We are looking forward to providing you top tier personal play analysis for Shadowlands,\r\n    Castle Nathria, and beyond. Thank you for your support, we hope you stick around.\r\n\r\n    <br/>- The WoWAnalyzer Team\r\n\r\n    <br/><br/>Please consider showing your support via <Link to=\"premium\">premium</Link> if you\r\n    appreciate this fan-made project.
